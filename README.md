# SVM-code-re-implementation
This repository contains a re-implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm from scratch. The project aims to provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to building an SVM classifier, showcasing key concepts like margin maximization, kernel trick, and Lagrange optimization.

## Features
* SVM with both linear and non-linear kernel support.
* Custom implementation of the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm.
* Demonstration of margin maximization and support vector selection.
* Visualizations for decision boundaries.
* Example notebooks for training and testing the model on various datasets.

## Goals
* Reinforce understanding of the underlying mathematics behind SVM.
* Provide an easy-to-follow implementation for educational purposes.
* Showcase the flexibility of SVMs in handling different types of classification problems.
